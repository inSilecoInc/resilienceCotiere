  abstract = {The occurrence of families of macroinvertebrates has recently been used as the basis for the BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party) system of assigning scores to lotic sites. In this study the performance of the system across 268 sites on 41 rivers providing a wide range of physical and chemical features has been appraised. Changes in score and ASPT (average score per taxon) with respect to season and sampling effort have been examined. Seasonal variations were relatively slight and it is concluded that samples taken in any of the three seasons, spring, summer or autumn, were likely to provide consistent estimates of score and particularly ASPT. Sample replication led to substantial accretion of scores but had little effect on ASPT and therefore more information was obtained for less effort when ASPT was used. Data are presented on score and ASPT values for 8 groups of sites derived by multivariate classificatory techniques. Considerable variability in achievable score and ASPT was observed in the different groups of unpolluted sites. In general, scores were highest in the group at the middle of the range of environmental features and lowest in groups at the bottom of the range (lowland areas). ASPT in contrast showed a relatively steady decline in values between groups at the top (mainly upland rivers) and bottom of the range of environmental features. Attempts were made to predict score and ASPT from physical and chemical data, or physical data alone using multiple regression. Equations used to predict ASPT explained on average a higher proportion of the variance (65}

This is derived from the proportions of individual abundance in five ecological groups, which are related to the degree of sensitivity/tolerance to an environmental stress gradient. The main difference with previously published indices is the use of a simple formula that produces a continuous Biotic Coefficient (BC) – which makes it more suitable for statistical analysis, in opposition with previous discreet biotic indices – not affected by subjectivity. Relationships between this coefficient and a complementary BI with several environmental variables are discussed. Finally, a validation of the proposed index is made with data from systems affected by recent human disturbances, showing that different anthropogenic changes in the environment can be detected through the use of this BI.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL), eastern Canada form a vast inland sea that is subjected to numerous anthropogenic pressures. Management tools are needed to detect and quantify their effect on benthic communities. The aims of this study are to analyze the spatial distribution of epibenthic communities in the EGSL and quantify the impact of important pressures on them to identify indicator taxa. Epibenthic communities were sampled at 1314 EGSL sites between 2011 and 2018 by bottom trawling. Cluster analyses revealed the presence of six distinct epibenthic communities that seem to be strongly influenced by oxygen concentration. Threshold analyses confirm that oxygen is an important predictor of epibenthic community composition and distribution. A major oxygen threshold is observed around 50–100 μmol O\textsubscript{2} L\textsuperscript{–1}, resulting in a shift of community type. At these concentrations and below, opportunistic taxa dominate the community while sensitive taxa are absent or present at very low abundance. Biomass of the latter only starts to increase when oxygen concentrations reach 150 μmol O\textsubscript{2} L\textsuperscript{–1}.

The spionid polychaete Marenzelleria arctia and pontoporeiid amphipod Monoporeia affinis are common macrobenthic species in the brackish Gulf of Finland (the easternmost Baltic Sea). This paper aims to apply the Benthic Opportunistic Polychaetes Amphipods (BOPA) and Benthic Opportunistic Annelid Amphipods (BO2A) indices based on the polychaete/amphipod ratio as indicators of the environmental state in this region. We analyzed the relationships between environmental variables and benthic indices based on samples from two benthic surveys in 2019 (10 sites) and 2020 (9 sites). The coastal sites were characterized by worse water quality (i.e., the higher concentration of hydrocarbons, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a), but cleaner sediments (i.e., total phosphorus, organic carbon, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and trace metals) than offshore sites. The BOPA and BO2A correlated positively with the level of water pollution and negatively with sediment pollution. The activity of the benthic organisms seems to strongly influence the concentration of contaminants in sediments, so this factor hinders the use of BOPA and BO2A indices for the assessment of bottom sediments quality in the eastern Baltic Sea. At the same time, this study shows that BOPA and BO2A indices can be used in assessing water quality.},

  abstract = {Correlative habitat models using relationships between marine organisms and their surrounding environment can be used to predict species distribution, and the results can assist management of human activities sharing the marine space (e.g. fisheries, MPAs, tourism). Here, epi-benthic megafauna was sampled at 755 stations in the Lower Estuary and Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) each summer between 2006 and 2009. We combined various types of multivariate analyses to 1) describe the structure and spatial distribution of benthic communities, 2) analyse the relationship between these communities and environmental parameters, and subsequently 3) build a community distribution model to predict the spatial distribution of the communities, creating community distribution maps covering the entire area to be used for marine management and conservation. We identified distinct benthic communities in the study area that closely correlate with the 200 m depth contour and with major environmental variables. A redundancy analysis revealed that communities were associated with depth, oxygen saturation, temperature, bottom current, seabed uniformity, distance to coast and type of sediment. Together these environmental descriptors explained 38\% of the variation in megafaunal community composition. The environmental variables were used to build a community distribution model using generalized linear models to predict high and low suitability zones of each community in the EGSL.},

  abstract = {M-AMBI is a multimetric index for assessing the ecological quality status of marine and transitional waters. It is based on benthic macroinvertebrates and integrates AMBI, a biotic index based on species sensitivity/tolerance, with diversity and richness, making it compliant with the European Water Framework Directive. The success of AMBI paved the way for the introduction of M-AMBI, which was subsequently incorporated into the regulations of several European countries. The M-AMBI algorithm integrates the metrics by means of factor analysis (FA). In this paper, we first reproduced the algorithm using the open source R software. This enabled us to point out that FA is not functional to M-AMBI, and its omission does not appreciably change the results. We then enhanced the applicability of the index, making it independent of the number of samples. In this way, M-AMBI is closely approximated by the simple mean of the normalised metrics with no need for multivariate techniques. Finally, we further simplified the approach, presenting a bivariate version that is still highly correlated with M-AMBI, in which the constitutive metrics are reduced to a diversity measure and a species sensitivity index. The properties of this bivariate version include simplicity, transparency, robustness, and openness.}

  abstract = {Although benthic infaunal communities are commonly measured to assess the effectiveness of environmental management in protecting biological resources, the tools used to interpret the resulting data are often subjective or site specific. We present an objective, quantitative index for application throughout the southern California coastal shelf environment that measures the condition of a benthic assemblage, with defined thresholds for levels of environmental disturbance. The index was calculated using a two-step process in which ordination analysis was employed to quantify a pollution gradient within a 717-sample calibration data set. The pollution tolerance of each species was determined based upon its distribution of abundance along the gradient. The index is calculated as the abundance-weighted average pollution tolerance of species in a sample. Thresholds were established for reference condition as well as for four levels of biological response. Reference condition was established as the index value in samples taken distant from areas of anthropogenic activity and for which no contaminants exceeded the effects range low (ERL) screening levels. The four response levels were established as the index values at which key community attributes were lost. Independent data sets were used to validate the index in three ways. First, index sensitivity to a spatial gradient of exposure to a discharge from a point source was tested. Second, index response to a temporal gradient of exposure to a discharge from a point source was examined, testing index robustness to natural temporal variation. Third, the effect of changes in natural habitat (e.g., substrate, depth, and latitude) on index sensitivity was tested by evaluating the ability of the index to segregate samples taken in areas with high and low chemical exposure, across a gradient of physical habitats.},

  abstract = {The EC Water Framework Directive requires that ecological quality be assessed in transitional waters using the abundance and species composition of macroalgae. In estuaries, which form the majority of transitional waters, species composition is not a suitable measure. This arises from two features: (i) there is a continuous, natural change in species composition along the gradient of estuarine conditions which makes it difficult to know where within an estuary the species composition should be assessed, (ii) the inner estuarine macroalgal community of mat-forming species is very tolerant to both natural and anthropogenic stress and species poor which makes it insensitive to environmental variations in terms of species composition. An alternative feature is proposed based on the extent of upstream penetration of perennial fucoid algae. This proposal is founded on a series of case studies of the changes in fucoid limits, within a number of estuaries in the British Isles, consequent upon changes in pollution status over the last three decades. This also has to take into account variations of fucoid penetration owing to natural factors such as range of salinity variation and turbidity. The abundance criterion is taken to mean the absence of macroalgal blooms or “green tides”, because general abundance of species is hard to quantify meaningfully in the upper estuarine mat-forming species and in the lower estuary is subject to great variation owing to the physical variability of estuary types.},
