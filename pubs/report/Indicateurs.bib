  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL), eastern Canada form a vast inland sea that is subjected to numerous anthropogenic pressures. Management tools are needed to detect and quantify their effect on benthic communities. The aims of this study are to analyze the spatial distribution of epibenthic communities in the EGSL and quantify the impact of important pressures on them to identify indicator taxa. Epibenthic communities were sampled at 1314 EGSL sites between 2011 and 2018 by bottom trawling. Cluster analyses revealed the presence of six distinct epibenthic communities that seem to be strongly influenced by oxygen concentration. Threshold analyses confirm that oxygen is an important predictor of epibenthic community composition and distribution. A major oxygen threshold is observed around 50–100 μmol O\textsubscript{2} L\textsuperscript{–1}, resulting in a shift of community type. At these concentrations and below, opportunistic taxa dominate the community while sensitive taxa are absent or present at very low abundance. Biomass of the latter only starts to increase when oxygen concentrations reach 150 μmol O\textsubscript{2} L\textsuperscript{–1}. The species {$<$}italic{$>$}Actinostola callosa{$<$}/italic{$>$}, {$<$}italic{$>$}Actinauge cristata{$<$}/italic{$>$}, {$<$}italic{$>$}Ctenodiscus crispatus{$<$}/italic{$>$}, and {$<$}italic{$>$}Brisaster fragilis{$<$}/italic{$>$} were identified as good indicators for detecting this impact threshold forepibenthic communities. This study provides threshold-based indicator species that help to establish and monitor the ecological state of epibenthic communities in a marine ecosystem exposed to multiple pressures.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Correlative habitat models using relationships between marine organisms and their surrounding environment can be used to predict species distribution, and the results can assist management of human activities sharing the marine space (e.g. fisheries, MPAs, tourism). Here, epi-benthic megafauna was sampled at 755 stations in the Lower Estuary and Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) each summer between 2006 and 2009. We combined various types of multivariate analyses to 1) describe the structure and spatial distribution of benthic communities, 2) analyse the relationship between these communities and environmental parameters, and subsequently 3) build a community distribution model to predict the spatial distribution of the communities, creating community distribution maps covering the entire area to be used for marine management and conservation. We identified distinct benthic communities in the study area that closely correlate with the 200 m depth contour and with major environmental variables. A redundancy analysis revealed that communities were associated with depth, oxygen saturation, temperature, bottom current, seabed uniformity, distance to coast and type of sediment. Together these environmental descriptors explained 38\% of the variation in megafaunal community composition. The environmental variables were used to build a community distribution model using generalized linear models to predict high and low suitability zones of each community in the EGSL.},
